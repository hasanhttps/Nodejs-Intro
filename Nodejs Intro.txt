Key Features of libuv:
Event Loop: At its core, libuv is built around an event loop that dispatches I/O events asynchronously. This is what allows Node.js to handle a large number of connections without creating new threads for each one.

Cross-Platform: It works across multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows, and others), abstracting the differences in their I/O systems.

Non-Blocking I/O: libuv provides an abstraction layer for non-blocking I/O, enabling operations like reading from files, making network requests, or interacting with the file system to run asynchronously, without blocking the main thread.

Thread Pool: For operations that cannot be non-blocking by nature (such as file system operations on some platforms), libuv uses a thread pool to execute them asynchronously.

Timers and Event Handling: libuv also provides utility functions for handling timers, signals, child processes, etc., which are useful for implementing event-driven architectures.
